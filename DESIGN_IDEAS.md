# Design Ideas

This project collects design thoughts for the website.

## Color Palette

The brand revolves around Bright Blue (`#0096FF`) and White (`#FFFFFF`). Additional colors have been chosen to support different UI components:

| Name | Hex | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Bright Blue | `#0096FF` | Primary actions, highlights |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Base background |
| Light Blue | `#66CCFF` | Secondary backgrounds or subtle accents |
| Navy | `#003F6D` | Header/footer backgrounds or hover states |
| Gray | `#F2F6FA` | Page background and neutral sections |
| Text | `#333333` | Primary text color |
| Accent Orange | `#FF7A00` | Notifications or accent elements |

## Layout Suggestions

- Keep the form centered with generous whitespace to maintain focus.
- Use Bright Blue for primary buttons and interactive elements.
- Apply Light Blue for input highlights and drop zones.
- Employ Navy as a hover color for buttons to provide clear feedback.
- Maintain plenty of contrast between background (White/Gray) and text.
